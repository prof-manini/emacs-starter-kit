=====================================
Yet another fork of Emacs Starter Kit
=====================================

This is a fork of the `Emacs Starter Kit`_ from my good friend Lele
Gaifas (lelit on github) which in turn is a fork of `Gabriele
Lanaro's`__ one which is a merge of the original Emacs Starter Kit and
his Emacs for Python files. You may learn a lot by tracing back the
history of this project, but all you need to know can be found on
`lele's`__ page.
